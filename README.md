# Final-project
this project was fun to make and made a challange for me. For my project I made a detectore that can tell you when a deer or a dog is in the range of the photo since my mom has a garden and my dogs and some deer eat her plants. To do this i coded a imge reciniation program that tells you what is what. I made it by telling you that a human, dog, and deer. To make the code you first make a project file on vs code and add a page to the file on the things you want it to see called label i did this by taking pictures already from the nano bot and using them to see what images are different things. As the code scanes them they have a higher rate that they get them correct. then you put all the images you get into vs code and code it to tell you when there is somthing like a deer or dog in the range. to run all these comands you make a Python.py page and put all the code in there and do /python3 Python.py
